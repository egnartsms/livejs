Tracked objects are persisted in disk files.  Inspected objects are objects that are
inspected on the FE side via REPL or code browser.  A tracked object can also be inspected
(in a REPL).

Tracked objects and inspected objects are represented using the same protocol, with
various fields/values admissible for only one kind or the other.


{
    type: "object",
    // only for inspected objects
    id: 234,
    // only for deep serialization of inspected objects
    value: {
       ...
    }
}


{
    type: "array",
    // only for inspected objects
    id: 234,
    // only for deep serialization of inspected objects
    value: [
       ...
    ]
}


{
    type: 'function',
    // only for inspected functions
    id: 234,
    value: func.toString()
}


{
    type: "leaf",
    // a string that is to be literally inserted in a REPL or module browser view.
    // So this may be "null", "true", "undefined" or "\"JS string\"".
    value: "/abc/"
}


// This is used for getters as lazily evaluated placeholders for real values of properties
// Only for inspected objects; makes no sense when serializing tracked objects.
{
    type: "unrevealed",
    parentId: 234,
    prop: "size"
}
